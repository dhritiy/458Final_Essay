#### **Dashboard Introduction**
***Project Goal:*** Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the majority of the world has faced a big a shift and had to move their lives indoors. There have been many dashboards created that attempt to analyze the negative impacts of the coronavirus and to perform risk analysis. However, with Earthdata dashboard, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aimed to go past the individual risk dashboard, and they tried to present a change in the Earth and climate due to the pandemic. Through the use of their monitoring systems, NASA has been able to track changes in multiple places across the world during this time.

Specifically, through this dashboard, NASA wanted to present changes that they saw in Water Quality, Air Quality, Landscapes, and Climate.

***Web Mapping Elements:***

***Authors and Sources:*** The majority of the data used in this dashboard was all collected by NASA through the use of the global satellite system. They were also able to gather some of this data by using scientific instruments that ar on the International Space Station and also through some ground observatories. In order to further the analysis presented in this dashboard, the authors (NASA scientistics), worked with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency(JAXA) and European Space Agency(ESA). By working with multiple agencies, they were able to perform a much deeper and more detailed analysis of climate change during the global pandemic.
